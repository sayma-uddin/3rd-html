	<h3><i>Bangladesh Men's Cricket Team History</i></h3>
	<p>Cricket was played in unified Bengal in the 18th and 19th centuries, but the eastern parts, modern-day Bangladesh, began to stage proper tournaments only in the 1950s, when the region was known as East Pakistan.</p>
	<p>An MCC side first toured Bangladesh in 1976-77. The cricket board of the time, the BCCB, put together a team for the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-trophy-1979-61172/match-schedule-fixtures-and-results?team=25">1979 ICC Trophy</a>, a qualifier for the World Cup then. Seven years on, Bangladesh played their first ODI. Their first appearance at cricket's biggest event was in 1999, alongside Scotland and Kenya, the teams they beat in the semi-final and final of the ICC Trophy in Malaysia two years before. The country's prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, led the rousing reception back home, with millions in attendance.</p>

	<p>Bangladesh's case for full membership of the ICC had been strengthened by their successful hosting of the <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/icc-trophy-1979-61172/match-schedule-fixtures-and-results?team=25">1998 ICC KnockOut Trophy</a>, and in the 1999 World Cup they beat favourites Pakistan in one of the biggest upsets in the tournament's history. The following season, a first-class competition was established in the country, and in June 2000, Bangladesh became the tenth Test-playing nation.</p>

Months after that win, against Zimbabwe, they were <b>humiliated</b> in their first Test at Lord's, though they made up somewhat by beating Australia in an ODI in Cardiff later on the tour.They only won their first Test after playing 34 matches.
